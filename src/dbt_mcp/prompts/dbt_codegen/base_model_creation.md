Create actual model files for multiple base/staging models from a source. This tool generates base model SQL for each specified table and creates the physical .sql files in your dbt project's models directory following the naming convention stg_{source}__{table}.sql. Includes complete SELECT statements with proper formatting, column aliasing, and optional model configuration blocks. Essential for automated base model file creation when scaffolding your staging layer. Always return confirmation of files created and their locations to the user.
