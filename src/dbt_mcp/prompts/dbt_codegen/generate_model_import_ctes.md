Generate import CTEs for a model based on its dependencies. This analyzes a model's compiled SQL to identify all ref() and source() dependencies, then creates properly formatted WITH statements that import each dependency at the beginning of the SQL file. Follows dbt best practices for CTE organization and naming conventions. Supports customizable comma placement. Essential for refactoring models to use explicit CTEs rather than inline references. Always return the generated CTE SQL output to the user.
