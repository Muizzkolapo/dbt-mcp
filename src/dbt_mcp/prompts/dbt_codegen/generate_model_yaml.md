Generate YAML documentation for dbt models by introspecting their compiled SQL. This tool analyzes one or more models to produce complete schema.yml entries with all column names and optionally their data types. Can intelligently inherit column descriptions from upstream models and sources for consistent documentation. Essential for maintaining comprehensive model documentation and enabling dbt's testing framework. Always return the generated YAML output to the user.
